# Regression

> Throughout the exercises for Regression in Python lessons, you will use the following example scenario: As a customer analyst, I want to know who has spent the most money with us over their lifetime. I have monthly charges and tenure, so I think I will be able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total_charges. I need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer.

## First we brought in the data and cleaned it up

[wrangle.py](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/ds-methodologies-exercises/blob/master/regression/wrangle.py) holds the functions that accomplish this and a walkthrough is available in [wrangle_walkthrough.ipynb](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/ds-methodologies-exercises/blob/master/regression/wrangle_walkthrough.ipynb).

## Then we needed some functions to split the data and to scale it

[split_scale.py](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/ds-methodologies-exercises/blob/master/regression/split_scale.py) holds the functions that accomplished this and a walkthrough is a available in [split_scale_walkthrough.ipynb](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/ds-methodologies-exercises/blob/master/regression/split_scale_walkthrough.ipynb).
